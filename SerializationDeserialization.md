Serialization:
Process of bringing an object into a form that can be written on stream so that it can be stored on a file, database or memory or transferred across a network.

Serialization is the translation of object's values to bytes to send it over network or save it.
TypesÂ : 1. Binary Serialization 2. XML Serialization 3. JSON Serialization.

Deserialization:
It is the process of getting back the serialized object so that it can be loaded into memory.
