.NET StandardÂ is a formal specification of .NET APIs that are intended to be available on all .NET implementations(.NetFramework, .Net Core, Xamarin, Silverlight, XBox etc)
.Net Standard is a specification which dictates what the Base Class Libraries of different .Net platforms should implement to unify the Base Class Libraries of 
different .Net Platforms. 
This also enables code sharing between applications that runs on these different platforms. For example, a library or a component that is developed on top of a platform 
that implements specific .Net Standard version can be shared by all the applications that runs on any of the platforms that implements same .Net Standard version.
Eg: A Game which is developed on one platform and has to be developed in others using common APIs.
