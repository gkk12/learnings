Structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups:

1.Models hold application data. They’re usually structs or simple classes.
2.Views display visual elements and controls on the screen. They’re typically subclasses of UIView.
3.View models: This is where the majority of code-behind goes: data access, click events, complex calculationsetc. They are typically built to reflect a View..

Eg: This pattern can be used to transform models into another representation for a view. For example, a Date can be transformed into a date-formatted String, 
a Decimal into a currency-formatted String.
