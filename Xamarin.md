Xamarin:
C# language: Xamarin uses a single language, C#, to create apps for all mobile platforms. Xamarin is natively compiled, 
which makes it a go-to option for building high-performance apps with native look and feel.
Uses C# as a language which is one of the .NET framework languages, it can be used with a number of useful .NET features such as Lambdas, LINQ, and Asynchronous programming (async/await).

Lambda
(input-parameters) => expression
(input-parameters) => { <sequence-of-statements> }

Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language. 

Xamarin vs Native App Development:
a)Reusability and Code Sharing
b)Xamarin – one tech stack, native- different tech stacks.
c)Code sharing – 
  Xamarin - yes, Native - no
d)UI/UX
  Xamarin- Complete UI customization is possible(IOS and Android), 
  Native -platform specific.
e)Performance – 
  Xamarin -good, Native - excellent.
f)Time to market- 
  With Xamarin forms its fast due to limited customizing and extensive code sharing, 
  Native - building for multiple platforms will require prolonged time or increase no of developers involved.
  
Xamarin Forms vs Xamarin Native:
1. Application development time:
  The amount of base code that is shared between the platforms is only 75% in Xamarin Native.
  Xamarin.Forms allows usage of a single XAML code for all the UI of all platforms thereby increasing the code sharing to almost a 100%.
  Hence, Application development is a lot faster with Xamarin.Forms.

2. Development Costs:
  Xamarin.Forms, needs a .Net developer to create a stunning application. In case of Xamarin Native though, a developer who has a good enough 
  experience in the native platforms as well to be able to write a good code for the UI of each is needed. This could add to some extra costs of developer resources.

3. UI complexity
  With Xamarin.Forms, since the UI code is shared among multiple platforms it can set some limits to the complexity of UI that can be easily implemented.
  Since Xamarin.Platform allows creation of UI specific to each platform, it becomes easier to add more intense graphics and other such animations. Some
  things may work well for one platform in a way, it may not work equally well for another and may require some alterations. Xamarin.Platform gives flexibility in this way.
  
4. Update and Maintenance:
  Since Xamarin.Forms shares almost all of the code for all three platforms, maintaining and regularly updating the application is a lot easier. This is primarily 
  because all the updates have to be performed on one single code.
  With Xamarin.Platform, you have to take care of the base code and then the individual sets of code for each platform separately. This adds more time and costs to 
  the maintenance and update process.

5. App functionalities
  There are features that are present in some platforms and absent in the other. In such a case, single Xamarin.Forms base code won’t help.
  Xamarin Native, on the other hand, can provide easy access to these specific native features in specific platforms.
  Applications with different functionalities for different platforms will be better created with Xamarin.Platform.
