Xamarin.Forms Layout classes allow us to arrange and group the UI controls.

1.Stack Layout: Stack Layout organizes the element in the one-dimensional stack horizontally or vertically. 
2.Grid Layout: A Grid is used to display the elements in rows and columns, which can have proportional or absolute sizes. A grid's rows and column are specified with the 
               RowDefinitions and ColoumnDefinitions properties. 
3.Flex Layout: A FlexLayout is similar to a StackLayout in that it displays child elements either horizontally or vertically in a stack. However, a FlexLayout can wrap 
               its children also if there are too many to fit in a single row or column, and also enable the more granular control of the size, orientation, and alignment of its child elements.
4.Absolute layout: Absolute Layout is used to position the child elements at the absolute requested position. Absolute Layout is used when we want to move away from all 
               the layout restriction and make the layout different. We can use proportional and absolute values to set the height, width, X-axis, and Y-axis of the element.
5.Relative Layout: Relative Layout can be used to position the views on the screen corresponding to the overall layout or other views.
6.Scroll View: Scroll View contains the layouts and enables them to scroll offscreen. Scroll View is also used to allow the views to move to the visible portion of the screen when the keyboard is showing.
