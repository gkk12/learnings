REST:
REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is a way to make it easier for systems on the web to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, 
are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server.

Advantages:
1.Systems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to know anything about what state the client is in and vice versa. In this way, both 
the server and the client can understand any message received, even without seeing previous messages. 
2.Code on the client side can be changed at any time without affecting the operation of the server, and the code on the server side can be changed without affecting the operation 
of the client.

REST request:
REST requires that a client make a request to the server in order to retrieve or modify data on the server. A request generally consists of:
an HTTP verb, which defines what kind of operation to perform
a header, which allows the client to pass along information about the request
a path to a resource
an optional message body containing data

GET - READ operation.
POST- CREATE operation.
PUT and PATCH-UPDATE operation.
DELETE- DELETE operation.
