## Delegates:
A delegate is an object which refers to a method or you can say it is a reference type variable that can hold a reference to the methods.
For example, if you click an Button on a form (Windows Form application), the program would call a specific method. In simple words, 
it is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type and then calls the method in a program 
for execution when it is needed.

Advantages of using Delegates:  
- Provides a good way to encapsulate the methods.
